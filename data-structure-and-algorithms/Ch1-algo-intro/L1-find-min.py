# As mentioned, an “algorithm” is just a set of instructions that can be carried out to solve a problem.
# It’s not anymore magical than that.

# In this course, we’ll be building pieces of a pretend social network: LockedIn. LockedIn is a place 
# for professionals to virtue signal about how all the for-profit work they do is actually an altruistic 
# endeavor. Think Facebook meets a job fair. It includes tools for influencers to track their growth.
#
# We need to show our users the accounts they follow with the lowest follower counts. This will help them 
# know who they follow that isn’t popular enough to be worth following anymore.

# Implement the “find minimum” algorithm in Python by completing the find_minimum() function. It accepts 
# a list of integers nums and returns the smallest number in the list.
#
# - Set minimum to positive infinity: float("inf").
# - If the list is empty, return None.
# - For each number in the list nums, compare it to minimum. If the number is smaller than minimum, set 
# minimum to that number.
# - minimum is now set to the smallest number in the list. Return it.
